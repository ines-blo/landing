		<h2>What's Easycook?👨‍🍳</h2>
		<p> Cooking easy is an application that allows you to suggest recipes according to your tastes, budget, diet or other criteria and will generate videos that match you thanks to an algorithm. The videos are made by chefs to ensure the taste and flavour of a good meal. In addition, some exclusive guests will appear in certain cooking videos to concoct their favourite dish with the chef
		<h2>The "plus" of the aplication 🏆</h2>
			<p>
			You often run out of ingredients to make the recipes on offer? No problem, you can order the food from our application at our partner shops at lower prices. You can then have them delivered or pick them up directly at the shop by click&collect.
